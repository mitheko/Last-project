            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Caritas Meru partnered with the Kenya Semi-Arid Livestock Enhancement Support (K-SALES) project, a United
                States Department of Agriculture (USDA) funded initiative, to strengthen the beef cattle, sheep, and
                goats (shoats) value chains. The project focused on improving livestock productivity, expanding trade in
                live animals and meat, and enhancing the value of hides, skins, and other livestock products.Through
                targeted interventions, K-SALES increased access to quality inputs, technologies,and services, leading
                to the adoption of better livestock practices and farm management techniques. The project also invested
                in improving water access, building the capacity of service providers, and promoting safe and hygienic
                meat production.To deliver these outcomes, K-SALES introduced a modular-based Farmer Field School(FFS)
                model guided by a facilitator’s manual. These FFSs served as focal training points,strengthening
                linkages between farmers, Business Service Providers (BSPs), and other key actors across the beef cattle
                and shoats value chains.</p>

        <h1>Biovision Foundation for Ecological Development</h1>
        <button class="togglebtn" onclick="toggleContent(this)">Click Me</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Caritas Meru partnered with the Biovision Foundation for Ecological Development, an international
                organization that advocates for a healthy planet, sustainable food systems, and ecological development.
                Together, the partnership focused on supporting the development of the Agroecology Policy and Bill for
                Meru and Tharaka Nithi Counties. The project emphasized inclusivity by ensuring that women, youth,
                children, and persons with disabilities (PWDs) actively participated in Agroecology Multi-Stakeholder
                Platforms (MSPs). This participatory approach enriched the policy-making process by bringing diverse
                perspectives to the table while fostering equity in ecological governance. To strengthen the policy
                framework, the initiative promoted intersectoral collaboration, aligning local agroecology discourse
                with broader national dialogues. Specifically, it ensured linkages to the National Inter-Sectoral Forum
                on Agro-Biodiversity and Agroecology (ISFAA), thereby creating a strong bridge between county and
                national policy processes.</p>
            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>The project aimed to strengthen synergies, enhance information flow, and foster collaboration between
                Meru and Tharaka Nithi Counties, as well as between county-level and national stakeholders, in
                agroecology-related policy development. This was achieved through active exchanges, joint learning, and
                dialogue facilitated by multi-stakeholder platforms such as ISFAA.</p>
            <ol class="goals">
                <li>Supported the drafting and advancement of county-level agroecology policies and bills.</li>
                <li>Ensured that vulnerable and marginalized groups had a voice in shaping policies that affect their
                    livelihoods.</li>
                <li>Built stronger collaboration between county and national actors on agroecology and agro-biodiversity
                    issues.</li>
                <li>Contributed to sustainable food systems and ecological resilience in Meru and Tharaka Nithi
                    Counties.</li>
                <p>Through this partnership, Caritas Meru and Biovision Foundation demonstrated the power of inclusive,
                    participatory policy-making in promoting sustainable agriculture, environmental stewardship, and
                    community resilience.</p>
