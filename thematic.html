        <h1>PARTNERSHIPS</h1>
        <p>Caritas Meru has established strong and strategic partnerships with both Meru and Tharaka Nithi County
            Governments.</p>
        <h1>Government Partnerships</h1>
        <p>Caritas Meru has built robust collaborations with Meru and Tharaka Nithi County
            Governments, working hand in hand to deliver sustainable development and improve the
            quality of life for communities. These partnerships are grounded in mutual trust, formalized
            through binding Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), and reinforced by active participation
            in county-level planning and implementation structures.</p>
        <h1>Sector Engagements</h1>
        <p>Caritas Meru engages directly with county governments through sector working groups,ensuring alignment of its
            programs with county development priorities. Key areas of collaboration include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Agriculture: Supporting food security and climate-smart farming practices.</li>
            <li>Livestock: Enhancing livestock health, productivity, and market access.</li>
            <li>Fisheries: Promoting sustainable aquaculture and nutrition-sensitive fish farming.</li>
            <li>Gender: Advancing gender equality and empowerment of women and girls.</li>
            <li>Education: Improving access to quality education and skills development.</li>
            <li>Health: Strengthening health systems and community access to essential services.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Through these platforms, Caritas Meru provides technical expertise, capacity building, and grassroots
            engagement, ensuring that county policies translate into tangible benefits for local communities.</p>
        <h1>Flagship Partnership Project</h1>
        <p>One notable example of Caritas Meru’s partnership with government is the implementation
            of the “Njaa Marufuku Kenya – Component 3” project (2013–2014). This government-led
            initiative, executed by Caritas Meru, aimed at enhancing resilience among vulnerable
            community members through:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Improved farming practices to boost agricultural productivity.</li>
            <li>Provision of productive assets to strengthen household livelihoods.</li>
            <li>Diversification of income sources to reduce dependency on rain-fed agriculture.</li>
            <li>Community mobilization for long-term food security and social stability.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This project empowered households to overcome cycles of hunger and poverty, leaving a lasting impact on
            resilience and self-reliance within the target communities.</p>
        <h1>Lasting Impact</h1>
        <p>By partnering with county governments, Caritas Meru has ensured that its interventions are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Integrated into county development strategies.</li>
            <li>Responsive to community needs and realities.</li>
            <li>Sustainable and scalable across sectors.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These collaborations reinforce Caritas Meru’s role as a trusted development partner,bridging the gap between
            government policy and grassroots action, and fostering a future of resilience, equity, and sustainable
            growth.</p>

        <h1>Caritas Meru Poultry Hatchery</h1>
        <p>Caritas Meru operates a modern poultry hatchery with a capacity of 1,024 eggs, strategically located at the
            Caritas Secretariat offices. The hatchery serves a dual purpose: generating sustainable income for the
            organization while also acting as a valuable community resource
            that strengthens local livelihoods and food security.</p>
        <p>Through this facility, Caritas Meru supports poultry farmers and households by providing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Day-old chicks for immediate rearing.</li>
            <li>One-week-old chicks for farmers seeking improved survival rates.</li>
            <li>One-month-old chicks for households that prefer more resilient birds ready for integration into
                smallholder systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The hatchery not only enhances access to quality poultry stock but also promotes affordable,small-scale
            agribusiness opportunities, particularly for women, youth, and vulnerable households who rely on poultry as
            a reliable source of nutrition and income. By reducing the
            need to source chicks from distant markets, the hatchery ensures that local farmers benefit from timely,
            accessible, and healthy birds, thereby improving productivity and profitability within the poultry value
            chain.
            Ultimately, the Caritas Meru hatchery is more than just an income-generating venture it is a community
            empowerment tool, designed to build self-reliance, improve household nutrition,and foster economic
            resilience across Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties.</p>
