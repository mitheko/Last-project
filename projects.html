        <h2>PICS BAGS PROJECT-Strengthening Food Security through Innovative Partnerships 2013 – 2014</h2>
        <button class="togglebtn" onclick="toggleContent(this)">Click Me</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>To enhance food security for smallholder farmers, Caritas Meru partnered with Purdue
                University to introduce the Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags. These cost-
                effective, triple-layer hermetic storage bags provide a safe and sustainable solution for
                storing harvested grains, peanuts, and other crops.
                Unlike conventional methods, PICS bags protect produce from pests and mould without the
                need for insecticides, making them both environmentally friendly and affordable. By reducing
                post-harvest losses, this technology empowers farmers to preserve the quality of their
                harvests, improve household food security, and increase income by selling their produce
                when market prices are most favorable.</p>
            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>Increase the use of hermetic storage technologies by 20 percent of grain stored on-farm
                Specific objectives:</p>
            <ol class="goals">
                <li>Build awareness by training farmers and other stakeholders in villages/farmer
                    groups while linking them to PICS bag vendors</li>
                <li>Develop a sustainable supply chain by identifying manufacturers and established distribution
                    networks of vendors.</li>
                <li>Build the capacity of the private sector, local scientists, and extension agents to sustain
                    post-harvest loss (PHL) reduction.</li>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Caritas Meru partnered with the Biovision Foundation for Ecological Development, an international
                organization that advocates for a healthy planet, sustainable food systems, and ecological development.
                Together, the partnership focused on supporting the development of the Agroecology Policy and Bill for
                Meru and Tharaka Nithi Counties. The project emphasized inclusivity by ensuring that women, youth,
                children, and persons with disabilities (PWDs) actively participated in Agroecology Multi-Stakeholder
                Platforms (MSPs). This participatory approach enriched the policy-making process by bringing diverse

                framework, the initiative promoted intersectoral collaboration, aligning local agroecology discourse
                with broader national dialogues. Specifically, it ensured linkages to the National Inter-Sectoral Forum
                on Agro-Biodiversity and Agroecology (ISFAA), thereby creating a strong bridge between county and
                national policy processes.</p>
